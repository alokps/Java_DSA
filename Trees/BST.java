How to determine if a binary tree is height-balanced?
A tree where no leaf is much farther away from the root than any other leaf. 
* Different balancing schemes allow different definitions of “much farther” and 
* different amounts of work to keep them balanced.Consider a height-balancing 
* scheme where following conditions should be checked 
* to determine if a binary tree is balanced.
An empty tree is height-balanced. A non-empty binary tree T is balanced if:
1) Left subtree of T is balanced
2) Right subtree of T is balanced
3) The difference between heights of left subtree and right subtree is not more than 1.

The above height-balancing scheme is used in AVL trees.
